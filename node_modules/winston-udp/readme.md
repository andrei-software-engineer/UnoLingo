# winston-udp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gjurgens/winston-udp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gjurgens/winston-udp)

A UDP transport for [winston][0].

## Installation

### Installing npm (node package manager)

``` sh
  $ curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
```

### Installing winston-udp

``` sh
  $ npm install winston
  $ npm install winston-udp
```

## Usage
``` js
  var winston = require('winston');

  //
  // Requiring `winston-udp` will expose
  // `winston.transports.UDP`
  //
  require('winston-udp').UDP;

  winston.add(winston.transports.UDP, options);
```

The UDP transport uses node's native [dgram](https://nodejs.org/api/dgram.html) behind the scenes.  Options are the following:

* __server:__ The address you want to send datagrams to. (default: `127.0.0.1`)
* __port:__ The port number you want to send datagrams to. (default: `9999`)
* __level:__ The minimum logging level that this transport will handle. (default: `info`)
* __formatter:__ The message formatter function. For more details, see [winston's repository](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#custom-log-format).
